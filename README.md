# Math Garden

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A fun way for children to practice addition by handwriting their answers.  

The TensorFlow model for predicting the handwritten digits was trained in batches of 1000 with two hidden layers, 50 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001. The model's accuracy on the test set was 97.58%.

### Web Processing
The logic for processing the digit drawn into the canvas into a format understood by the model lies in the processing.js file.

### Drawing Logic
drawing.js contains the logic to display visuals for the game. 

### Game Logic
Everytime a correct number is drawn on the canvas, the game plants a flower in the garden(webpage) and if an incorrect answer is inputted the flowers in the garden begin to wilt. The code implementing this logic can be found in math.js.
