<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A fun way for children to practice addition by handwriting their answers.  

The TensorFlow model for predicting the handwritten digits was trained in batches of 1000 with two hidden layers, 50 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001. The model's accuracy on the test set was 97.58%.

### Web Processing
The digits drawn by the user into the canvas is processed into format usable by the model in the processing.js file.

### Drawing Logic
drawing.js contains the logic for user interactions when playing the game. 

### Game Logic
Game visuals are displayed according to user answers and their correctness. The game logic is implemented in math.js.
